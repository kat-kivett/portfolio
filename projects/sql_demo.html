							<h1>Retail Product Mix Data Aggregation</h1>
							<p class="major">Use SQL to aggregate data and pull in attributes. Further aggregate and prepare data for reporting by using CTEs, window functions, and other important SQL elements.</p>
                            <p>This analysis is meant to showcase various tasks and skills in SQL. This would not be a finished product that would be shared with leadership, but would rather be informing next steps in analysis and exploration.</p>

										<p>A task can be accomplished in many different ways in SQL. In this project I used a variety of different functions and techniques to showcase range in the tools and language. For example, a window function, CTE, temp table or subquery could be appropriate in a project for any variety of reasons, including efficiency, readability, or limitations of the flavor of SQL used by an organization.</p>

                                <p>A fictional retailer has data regarding their sales, orders, and products in a series of tables. We can write queries to extract, filter, join, sort, and further aggregate this data to answer business questions and produce reporting.</p>

											<h3>Overall Sales Observations</h3>

										<div class="content">
                                            
<p>The first task is to view a sample of the data. By querying just a few rows (here 10, but could be in any quantity) we can get a quick feel for the structure and content.</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT TOP(10) * FROM dbo.customer_data;
    SELECT TOP(10) * FROM dbo.item_data;
    SELECT TOP(10) * FROM dbo.order_data;
    SELECT TOP(10) * FROM dbo.product_type;
    SELECT TOP(10) * FROM dbo.sale_data;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/top10.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>Now we'll run a simple query to see which item has the most units ordered. The item_data table gives us the EAN and product name, however we'll need to fetch the sales figures from the sale_data table.</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT 
        i.EAN,
        i.product,
        SUM(s.quantityOrdered) AS quantityOrdered
    FROM item_data i 
    JOIN sale_data s 
	    ON i.EAN = s.EAN
    GROUP BY
        i.EAN,
        i.product
    ORDER BY 
        SUM(s.quantityOrdered) DESC;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/quantityOrdered.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>Units ordered and Sales Dollars generated are not the same thing. We can get a better feel for the amount of money made on these orders by calculating the total Retail Sales and Margin Dollars generated.</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT 
        i.EAN,
        i.product,
        SUM(s.quantityOrdered) AS quantityOrdered,
        SUM(s.quantityOrdered) * i.retail AS retailSales,
        SUM(s.quantityOrdered) * i.margin AS marginDollars
    FROM item_data i 
    JOIN sale_data s 
	    ON i.EAN = s.EAN
    GROUP BY
        i.EAN,
        i.product,
        i.retail,
        i.margin
    ORDER BY 
        SUM(s.quantityOrdered) DESC;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/retailAndMargin.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>And if we want to order these so we can see which products are our top margin producers? Depending on which version of SQL you are working with this can differ in syntax. Even within the same SQL there are options for query structure. I am choosing to utilize a subquery in my inner join. We'll also filter down to just products with at least 10,000 units sold.</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT 
        i.EAN,
        i.product,
        sq.quantityOrdered,
        sq.retailSales,
        sq.marginDollars
    FROM item_data i 
    JOIN (SELECT 
		i.EAN,
		SUM(s.quantityOrdered) AS quantityOrdered,
		SUM(s.quantityOrdered) * i.retail AS retailSales,
		SUM(s.quantityOrdered) * i.margin AS marginDollars
		FROM item_data i
		JOIN sale_data s 
		    ON i.EAN = s.EAN        
		GROUP BY
		    i.EAN,
		    i.retail,
		    i.margin) sq
    ON sq.EAN = i.EAN
    WHERE 
        1=1
        AND sq.quantityOrdered >= 10000
    ORDER BY 
        sq.marginDollars DESC;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/topMarginProducts.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>Are our top producing items by unit the same as by retail, or by margin dollars? Using window functions to create a rank on each metric (quantity ordered, retail sales, margin dollars) provides a quick and easy way to visualize how these products stack up.</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT 
        i.EAN,
        i.product,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sq.quantityOrdered DESC) AS quantityOrderedRank,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sq.retailSales DESC) AS retailSalesRank,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY sq.marginDollars DESC) AS marginDollarsRank
    FROM item_data i 
    JOIN (SELECT 
            i.EAN,
            SUM(s.quantityOrdered) AS quantityOrdered,
            SUM(s.quantityOrdered) * i.retail AS retailSales,
            SUM(s.quantityOrdered) * i.margin AS marginDollars
            FROM item_data i
            JOIN sale_data s 
            ON i.EAN = s.EAN
            GROUP BY
            i.EAN,
            i.retail,
            i.margin) sq
    ON sq.EAN = i.EAN
    GROUP BY 
        i.EAN,
        i.product,
        sq.quantityOrdered,
        sq.retailSales,
        sq.marginDollars
    ORDER BY 
        sq.marginDollars DESC;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/salesRanks.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>Some data extraction and cleansing is required to get a full picture of this company's sales landscape. For example, we have the full address for customer orders, but these are not broken out by state. That can be extracted in the subquery. Since the address format is very consistent in using a 5 digit zipcode we can do a substring.</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT 
        sq.orderState,
        SUM(sq.quantityOrdered) AS quantityOrdered,
        SUM(sq.retailSales) AS retailSales,
        SUM(sq.marginDollars) AS marginDollars
        FROM item_data i 
    JOIN (SELECT 
		i.EAN,
		SUBSTRING(c.purchaseAddress, len(c.purchaseAddress)-7, 2) orderState,
		SUM(s.quantityOrdered) AS quantityOrdered,
		SUM(s.quantityOrdered) * i.retail AS retailSales,
		SUM(s.quantityOrdered) * i.margin AS marginDollars
		FROM item_data i
		JOIN sale_data s 
		    ON i.EAN = s.EAN
		JOIN dbo.order_data o
		    ON o.orderID = s.orderID
		JOIN dbo.customer_data c 
		    ON o.custID = c.custID
		GROUP BY
		i.EAN,
		i.retail,
		i.margin,
		c.purchaseAddress) sq
    ON sq.EAN = i.EAN
    GROUP BY 
        sq.orderState
    ORDER BY 
        SUM(sq.retailSales) DESC;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/salesByState.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>SQL can also perform the heavy-lifting when it comes to data aggregation and structure. For example, some data visualization and dashboarding tools have a difficult time with Month over Month or Year over Year calculations. We can work around those limitations by restructuring data now. I can use a window function to create a Month over Month format that would easily feed into a tool like PowerBI, LookerStudio, or Tableau.</p>
<pre><code>
WITH attributes AS (

    SELECT 
        YEAR(o.orderDate)*100+MONTH(o.orderDate) AS orderMonth, 
        i.product AS productName,
        SUM(s.quantityOrdered) AS quantityOrdered
    FROM dbo.order_data o 
    JOIN dbo.sale_data s
        ON o.orderID = s.orderID
    JOIN dbo.item_data i
        ON s.EAN = i.EAN
    GROUP BY 
        o.orderDate, 
        i.product)

    SELECT 
        a.orderMonth,
        a.productName,
        SUM(a.quantityOrdered) AS currentMonthOrdered,
        LAG(SUM(a.quantityOrdered), 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY a.productName ORDER BY a.orderMonth) AS priorMonthOrdered
    FROM attributes a
    GROUP BY 
        a.orderMonth, 
        a.productName;
</code></pre>
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/salesMonthOverMonth.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>Last but not least I want to join multiple tables and do some additional formatting, both to data and my data labels. The purpose for this prettied up flat file is to do some further work outside of SQL. I'll utilize this table in a Storytelling with Data style insightful analysis and use it to produce various visualizations.</p>
<pre><code>
    SELECT 
        DATENAME(MONTH, DATEADD(MONTH, DATEPART(mm,o.orderDate), -1)) AS [Month],
        YEAR(o.orderDate)*100+MONTH(o.orderDate) AS [Order Month], 
        SUBSTRING(c.purchaseAddress, LEN(c.purchaseAddress)-7 ,2) AS [Order State],
        i.product AS [Product],
        p.Product_Type AS [Product Type],
        SUM(s.quantityOrdered) AS [Quantity Ordered],
        SUM(s.retail) * SUM(s.quantityOrdered)  AS [Retail],
        (SUM(s.retail) - SUM(s.costOfGoods)) * SUM(s.quantityOrdered)  AS [Margin]
    FROM dbo.order_data o 
    JOIN dbo.customer_data c 
        ON o.custID = c.custID
    JOIN dbo.sale_data s
        ON o.orderID = s.orderID
    JOIN dbo.item_data i
        ON s.EAN = i.EAN
    JOIN dbo.product_type p
        ON i.product = p.Product
    GROUP BY 
        o.orderID, 
        c.custID, 
        o.orderDate, 
        c.purchaseAddress, 
        s.EAN, 
        i.product, 
        p.Product_Type;
